Seeds and weeds, oh so many weeds. Broken looms and worn out brushes. Rusty cans and cobblestone walkways. Elephants crushing mud houses because rage (sensless murder).</p><p>Our work: dressed up passion and the fighting words of the post modern robot. A direct repulsion for the mass produced yet embraced revolutionary distribution networks. Borrow heavily when necessary from the modern world but live in the ancient.</p><p>There are stories and then there are compulsions. An honesty drerived from mud stained finger nails and a devotion to feelings the seasons of our great earth. Nomads at heart we borrow from the homsteader simply to feed ourselves poison free.</p><p>We are all slowly going the way of the buffalo but before them we skip sunsets off of water falls in the empty corner wilderness between electrons and commuter nightmares. The ancestrial lineage pulses deep in our ground paws we can't help but sing to the moon and tweet about it later. This is modern ancient.</p></section></section><section class=about><section id=kyle><img src=/images/9dc9.youtake.jpg><p>The paintings float in from no where leaving quietly in kind. Some of them torment me and some simply fall from the tip of the brush effortlessly - evening rain on the banana leaf. I can’t really say where they come from, at least not exactly. Nor do they have a particular purpose. Though when looking at them you’ll <i>see</i> something and that is what I offer: the space around the edges where familiarity resides kneaded with the mysterious unknown.</p><p>I dream of a future where the animals take the best parts of technology from us and evolve far enough along to clean up the derelict strip malls and plastic water bottle islands. A time when we are encouraged to talk with the nesting robins stealing earth worms from the garden beds while marking time with the motion of the moon.</p><p>You see one day very soon (oh so soon) we are all going to be interacting with robots daily though often not able to discern <i>if</i> they are robots or <i>if</i> they are human. Frightening. The streamlined efficiency this mechanized intelligence will bring to commerce will be counter weighted heavily against the metaphysical crisis imposed upon our human psyche. Senses distrusted fail our rational; Hume laughs. Newfound neurosis occupying newfound leisure.</p><p>Yet this omniscient interconnected pan-cognizant future will also allow us to realize everyone bleeds and loves and laughs the exact same way and though dogma might cause us to dye our cloth differently that is no reason to kill each other. And so I dream of this world, when elephants tweet about good water holes and mud baths and us humans share space with the bees.</p><p>[Brief Pause]</p><p>The craft and materials of oil painting are of great interest to me. The act of making these objects is a mediation before the storm of creation; it’s a chance to participate in the more tactile maker space of the head before I float off into the world of imagination. Some days I just want to use tools to make things. Old techniques are utilized in the preparation of the ground, paints and mediums to be spread on heirloom quality supports and I hand weave linen canvas in complex patterns to provide gorgeous geometric backgrounds and textures for my panels.</p></section><section id=jeannie><img src=/images/54ba.itake.jpg><p>Adornment. A compulsion to create the perfect objects to swaddle our naked bodies, drape them in fibers from the earth, anoint them with treasures from all times and places. A desire to touch what is real, and to connect with the other, which is actually ourselves all allong. As we will find.</p><p>Beginning at the beginning, fibers and threads. Arranging them in such a way as to create fabric, thick or thin, to protect from the sun or from the snow. The fibers of plants and animals guide my hands into doing what they must do. To create. Because we are all just human being after all. After we strip away the antiseptic bubbles that we have placed ourselves in we are our ancestors, longing for the rituals of life, birth, remembering and death. For these things we wear objects to help us remember.</p></section></section><section><footer class=footer><div class=footer-logo><img src=/images/5dd7.logo.png alt=""></div><div class=footer-links><ul><li><h3>Works for Sale</h3></li><li><a href=https://www.etsy.com/shop/newtribetextiles>Our Etsy Shop</a></li></ul><ul><li><h3>Follow Us</h3></li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/newtribetextiles>Facebook</a></li><li><a href=http://twitter.com/hmsp>Twitter</a></li></ul><ul><li><h3>Our Blogs</h3></li><li><a href=http://moontoad.net>Moon Toad</a></li><li><a href=http://newtribetextiles.net>New Tribe Textiles</a></li></ul></div><hr><p>All content creative commons.</p></footer><!--[if lte IE 8]>
